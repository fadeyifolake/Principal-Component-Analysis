## Overview
In this project, I have implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to acquire essential variables from the cancer dataset available from sklearn.datasets. The dataset has been reduced into 2 PCA components for further analysis. 

## Tasks

### 1. PCA Implementation

- Utilized PCA to demonstrate how essential variables can be acquired from the cancer dataset.

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

- Reduced the dataset into 2 PCA components.


- Implemented logistic regression for prediction.


## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries (scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, etc.).
2. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. **Run Code**: Execute the PCA implementation script to perform dimensionality reduction
